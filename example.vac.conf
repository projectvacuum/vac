#
# The 2 domain names below are:
#
# vac01.example.com - the Vac space name (used as the CE name where necessary)
#  wn01.example.com - the name of this factory machine

[settings]
# Name of this vac space. Should be a DNS-like name, and will be needed to
# when referring to this vac space as a virtual CE in other systems.

# total_machines allows you to say how many VMs Vac will manage.
# Vac will take the hostname of the factory to make the name of the VMs.
# On wn01.example.com, they will be wn01-00.example.com, 
# wn01-01.example.com, wn01-02.example.com, ...

[factories]
# A list of all the factory machines in this space. To add more factories,
# add them to the names= line, separated by spaces. You can use '\' as the
# last character of a line to continue the name= assignment.
names = wn01.example.com
