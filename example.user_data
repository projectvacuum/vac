# This is the example user_data template file for testing a new or 
# upgraded installation of Vac, as described in the Vac Admin Guide.
# See http://www.gridpp.ac.uk/vac/ for the guide and more about Vac.
#
# Inside the VM, the user_data script section creates a file in
# the machineoutputs directory, waits 5 minutes, then shuts down
# the VM. 
#
# In the [machinetype example] section of your /etc/vac.conf you must
# include this option to tell the VMs where the proxy cache that
#Â you use for cvmfs is located:
#
# user_data_option_cvmfs_proxy = http://YOUR.HTTP.PROXY:PORT
#
# All other ##user_data__## sustitutions for this template are
# generated automatically by Vac.
