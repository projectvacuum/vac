.SH NAME
.B vac.conf
\- Vac configuration file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B vacd
is a daemon which implements the Vacuum model on a factory (hypervisor)
machine. vacd reads its configuration from
.B /etc/vac.conf
and this file is also read by the
.B vac
utility command to find default values.

vac.conf uses the Python ConfigParser syntax, which is similar to MS
Windows INI files. The file is divided into sections, with each section
name in square brackets. For example: [settings]. Each section contains
a series of option=value pairs.

For ease of management, three more optional files are read if they exist:
.br
"/etc/vac-virtualmachines.conf"
.br 
"/etc/vac-factories.conf"
.br 
"/etc/vac-targetshares.conf"
.PP
These files are named after important sections, but sections can be placed
in any of the four files, or all placed in /etc/vac.conf

.SH [SETTINGS] OPTIONS

The [settings] section is required and has options which apply to all virtual
machines. 

.B vac_space
is required and gives the name of this Vac space. A single space will be
sufficient for many sites. The space name should be a fully qualified domain
name, like vac.example.com and may be treated as space's CE name in some
monitoring and accounting systems.

.B cycle_seconds
is how long to wait before re-evaluating state of VMs in the main loop again.
Defaults to 60 seconds.

.B udp_timeout_seconds
is how long to wait before giving up on more UDP replies. Defaults to 5.0
seconds.

.B domain_type
gives the type of hypervisor used, and can be either kvm or xen. kvm is the
default and is the preferred choice for production use.

.B delete_old_files
can be set to False to disable the normal behaviour where old files associated
with transient VMs which have finished are deleted. This can be useful for
debugging but can easily allow disks to fill up.

.B vcpu_per_machine
sets the number of virtual CPUs to assign to each VM. Defaults to 1.

.B mb_per_machine
sets the memory allocated to each VM in MiB. Defaults to 2048.

.B version_logger
can be used to disable the logging of the version in use. Normally
Vac sends one UDP packet per day to vac-version-logger.gridpp.ac.uk
on port 8884 containing the factory and space names, and the Vac
version number. This will be used to target patches for security
and bugs at the versions currently in use. Defaults to True.

.B total_machines
gives the number of VMs to be defined by Vac rather than in 
[virtualmachine ...] sections in the configuration file(s). These two
mechanisms cannot be used on the same factory, and any 
[virtualmachine ...] sections will be ignored if total_machines is
given. The VM names are formed by
adding a hyphen and the VM number to the hostname component of its fully
qualified domain name. For example, factory1.example.com would have
factory1-00.example.com, factory1-01.example.com, ... as its VMs. MAC
addresses are formed with the prefix 56:4D as the first two bytes, and
the four bytes of the IP address as the remaining four bytes.

.B volume_group
can be used to set the volume group to be searched for a logical volume
which can be used by a particular VM. The logical volumes must have the
VMs fully qualified domain names as their names. For example, 
/dev/vac_volume_group/facory1-00.example.com/ would used by the VM
factory1-00.example.com. Defaults to vac_volume_group.

.B network_type
selects between bridge and nat as styles of networking. If nat is given,
then the total_machines setting must also be used. Defaults to bridge.

.B nat_network
allows the C-class private network use by Vac for NAT to be chosen. Vac
will pre-allocate a large number of IP addresses within this network
and associate MAC addresses with them. Defaults to 192.168.86.0.

.B bridge_device
allows a device name to be set in bridging mode, to match the bridge
device on the factory host that can be seen using ifconfig.
Defaults to p1p1 when using kvm and br-eth0 with Xen.

.SH [VMTYPE ...] SECTIONS

One [vmtype ...] section must exist for each vmtype in the system, with
the name of the vmtype given in the section name, such as [vmtype example].
A vmtype name must only consist of lowercase letters, numbers, periods,
underscores, and hyphens. Each of these sections contain option=value
pairs that are specific to that vmtype.

.B backoff_seconds
is the delay after a VM of this vmtype aborts. If a VM aborts, then no new
VMs of this type will be created for this amount of time. This can be used 
to prevent the unnecessary creation of many VMs when no work is available,
and avoid overloading the matcher or task queue of the VO. 

.B fizzle_seconds
is in three places within the backoff algorithm. First, if a VM finishes
without producing a shutdown message code and has lasted less than 
fizzle_seconds, then it is treated as aborted. Secondly, after the 
backoff_seconds time has expired for a VM abort, once at least one VM has
been started in this Vac space, then no more new VMs can be started for 
another fizzle_seconds. Thirdly, these new VMs are identified because
they are still in the starting phase of creating files, or because they
have been running for less than fizzle_seconds.

.B max_wallclock_seconds
gives the maximum lifetime of a VM. Vac will destroy the VM if it is still
running after this amount of time, and will create 
/etc/machinefeatures/shutdowntime using this value to communicate it to the
VM. Default 86400.

.B shutdown_command
is the path to a file inside the VM which the VM can use to shut itself down.
This value is written to /etc/machinefeatures/shutdown_command. The script
/var/lib/vac/bin/vac-shutdown-vm is suitable for this, and is 
available at the NFS-exported location /etc/machinefeatures/vac-shutdown-vm 
in the VM.

Running the vac-shutdown-vm command from a non-root use can be accomplished
by appending lines like this to /etc/sudoers, with USER as the user name:

.br
Defaults:USER !requiretty
.br
Defaults:USER visiblepw
.br
USER ALL = NOPASSWD: /etc/machinefeatures/vac-shutdown-vm

.B root_device
is the device name exposed to the VM that is associated with the root
disk image. Default hda.

.B scratch_device
is the device name exposed to the VM that is associated with the scratch
logical volume. Default hdb.

.B log_machineoutputs
can be set to True to enable recording of all the files in 
/etc/machineoutputs in the file /var/log/vacd-machineoutputs when the
VM finishes or is killed. For this reason, only text files should be
written to this directory. Default False.

.B accounting_fqan
is used to specify a userFQAN to include in the blahp accounting 
entries in the /var/log/vacd-accounting/ log files. 

For the remaining options, if the file name begins with '/', then it
will be used as an absolute path; otherwise the path will be interpreted
relative to the vmtype's subdirectory of /var/lib/vac/vmtypes

.B rootpublickey
is the file name of a public key supplied to the contextualization which
will be allowed root ssh access. If the file begins with '/', then it
will be used as an absolute path; otherwise the path will be interpreted
relative to the vmtype's subdirectory of /var/lib/vac/vmtypes

.B user_data
is a contextualization file provided by the VO and perhaps modified by
the site. 

.B prolog
and
.B epilog
are file names of optional prolog.sh and epilog.sh scripts as defined in
the CernVM contextualization documentation.

.SH [TARGETSHARES] SECTION

The [targetshares] section contains a list of vmtype=share pairs giving
the desired share of the total VMs available in this space for each
vmtype. The shares do not need to add up to 1.0, and if a share is not given
for a vmtype, then it is set to 0. Vac factories consult these shares
when deciding which vmtype to start as VMs become available.

.SH [FACTORIES] SECTION

The [factories] section contains the single required option 
.B name
which has a space separated list of the fully qualified domain names of all
the factories in this Vac space, including this factory. The factories are
queried using UDP when a factory needs to decide which vmtype to start.
The Vac responder process on the factories replies to these queries with
a summary of the VM and the outcome of recent attempts to run a VM of each
vmtype.

.SH [VIRTUALMACHINE ...] SECTIONS

If the total_machines option is not given in [settings], then 
one [virtualmachine ...] section must exist for each virtual machine 
assigned to this factory machine, with its fully qualified domain name 
given in the section name, such as [virtualmachine vm1.example.com].
Each of these sections contain one or two option=value pairs that are 
specific to that virtualmachine.

.B mac
is the MAC address of the virtual network interface used by the VM. You can
allocate MAC addresses from the locally administered range. This must be 
unique across the local network. A convenient way to achieve this is to
convert the 4 bytes of the virtual machine's IP address into hexadecimal 
and use them as the final 8 hex digits of the MAC address. For the first 4
digits a prefix in the locally administered range, such as 56:4D, must be
used. For example, 192.168.1.80 maps to 56:4D:C0:A8:01:50 (0x56 0x4D is 
VM in ASCII.)

.B scratch_volume
is optional and if given will be used by Vac as a logical volume which can
be attached to the VM. The scratch_volume option will be a device file, 
similar to /dev/vac_volume_group/vm1.example.com_scratch
Vac will first format the volume as ext3, and then 
attach it the VM using the value of 
.B scratch_device
for the vmtype.
