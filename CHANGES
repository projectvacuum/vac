==================== Changes in Vac version 0.11.0 =====================
- Remove _name from vac_ entries in /etc/machinefeatures and add 
  vac_vmtype
==================== Changes in Vac version 0.10.0 =====================
- Mistakes in configuration file(s) now produce an error rather than a
  traceback. vacd now just skips the cycle if the configuration is bad,
  in the hope of it being fixed in the future.  
- total_machines option added to configuration files, so the number
  of VMs desired can be given rather then listing them as virtualmachine
  sections of the file. 
- network_type can be used to specify NAT rather than a bridged network.
- version_logger option allows control over daily logging by UDP of the
  Vac version number in use to vac-version-logger.gridpp.ac.uk:8884
- volume_group, nat_network, and bridge_device options allow tailoring
  of the defaults Vac uses when making disk and network resources 
  available to VMs.
