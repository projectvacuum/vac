==================== Changes in Vac version 0.10.0 =====================
- Mistakes in configuration file(s) now produce an error rather than a
  traceback. vacd now just skips the cycle if the configuration is bad,
  in the hope of it being fixed in the future.  
- virtualmachines option added to configuration files, so the number
  of VMs desired can be given rather then listing them as virtualmachine
  sections of the file.
