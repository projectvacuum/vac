- Apply cpu_per_machine properly
- Add overload_per_cpu to stop thashing when cvmfs-intensive VMs start

  and ignore /etc/vac-factories.conf and /etc/vac-targetshares.conf 
- vacd processes VMs in numeric order to improve predictability
- Change CeID in BLAHP accounting logs to 'space_name/vac-vmtype' format
- Add setSockBufferSize() which increases system max if necessary and
  sets per-socket buffer size for receiving UDP
- Add quick check of iptables-save output in case NAT rules created by
  libvirt have been removed
- The default disk devices are now /dev/vda and /dev/vdb, not hda/hdb

  expiration controlled by machineoutputs_days

- --include-hs06 and --include-versions in vac scan command; and add
  vmtype and raw commands

==================== Changes in Vac version 0.14.0 =====================

- Extra double-quote fix to VAC.py from Ewan MacMahon
- Close and reopen log files at each cycle, to accommodate logrotate
- Add cpu_total option to limit the number of processors to allocate

  be created, allowing dynamic reconfiguration on production factories

- Use HS06 totals rather than VM totals in target shares
- Change vcpu_per_machine to cpu_per_machine and hs06_per_machine to
  hs06_per_cpu in vac.conf
==================== Changes in Vac version 0.13.0 =====================
- Remove bridge networking
- Remove [virtualmachine ...] configuration sections
- Always use 169.254.169.* for VM IPs, and 169.254.169.254 for factory
- Add entries in /etc/hosts for VM IPs
- Don't do accounting logs for VMs that last less than fizzle_seconds
- Fully populate /etc/machinefeatures and /etc/jobfeatures, including
  hs06_per_machine option and measured size of the scratch partition
- Move assumed vac-shutdown-vm location to /etc/vmtypefiles
- Require lvm2 in SPEC file so we get lvs command to read partition size
==================== Changes in Vac version 0.12.0 =====================
- Add accounting logs in PBS and BLAHP format, optionally including a
  FQAN from the accounting_fqan option for the vmtype.
==================== Changes in Vac version 0.11.0 =====================
- Remove _name from vac_ entries in /etc/machinefeatures and add 
  vac_vmtype
- Automatically copy vac-shutdown-vm into /etc/machinefeatures 
- Add log_machineoutputs to [vmtype ...] sections so contents of 
  /etc/machineoutputs can be written to /var/log/vacd-machineoutputs
==================== Changes in Vac version 0.10.0 =====================
- Mistakes in configuration file(s) now produce an error rather than a
  traceback. vacd now just skips the cycle if the configuration is bad,
  in the hope of it being fixed in the future.  
- total_machines option added to configuration files, so the number
  of VMs desired can be given rather then listing them as virtualmachine
  sections of the file. 
- network_type can be used to specify NAT rather than a bridged network.
- version_logger option allows control over daily logging by UDP of the
  Vac version number in use to vac-version-logger.gridpp.ac.uk:8884
- volume_group, nat_network, and bridge_device options allow tailoring
  of the defaults Vac uses when making disk and network resources 
  available to VMs.
