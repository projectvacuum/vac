==================== Changes in Vac version 0.15.1 =====================
- Fix mtime exception when using heartbeat_file
- Apply cpu_per_machine properly
==================== Changes in Vac version 0.15.0 =====================
- Add vm_model option in vmtype sections (default cernvm2)
- Add cernvm3 vm_model and uCernVM 3 support
- Use /var/lib/vac/machineoutputs rather than vacd-machineoutputs, with
  expiration controlled by machineoutputs_days
- Use error_policy='report' on QEMU disks to avoid random VM pausing
- Add cernvm3iso.spec to doc directory
- --include-hs06 and --include-versions in vac scan command; and add
  vmtype and raw commands
- Change process names to vacd-factory and vacd-responder 
- Each VM now has VNC predictably on port 5900 + VM number
- Add heartbeat_file and heartbeat_seconds to allow vmtypes to nominate
  a file they will create and update in /etc/machineoutputs
- NFS directories are exported no_root_squash to allow 0600 mode files
- Shutdown messages with 6xx codes trigger backoff now too
==================== Changes in Vac version 0.14.0 =====================
- Include vacd file for /etc/logrotate.d
- Extra double-quote fix to VAC.py from Ewan MacMahon
- Close and reopen log files at each cycle, to accommodate logrotate
- Add cpu_total option to limit the number of processors to allocate
- Use cpu_total and cpu_per_machine to calculate whether a new VM can
  be created, allowing dynamic reconfiguration on production factories
- Add ncpus to PBS style accounting logs
- Use HS06 totals rather than VM totals in target shares
- Change vcpu_per_machine to cpu_per_machine and hs06_per_machine to
  hs06_per_cpu in vac.conf
==================== Changes in Vac version 0.13.0 =====================
- Remove bridge networking
- Remove [virtualmachine ...] configuration sections
- Always use 169.254.169.* for VM IPs, and 169.254.169.254 for factory
- Add entries in /etc/hosts for VM IPs
- Don't do accounting logs for VMs that last less than fizzle_seconds
- Fully populate /etc/machinefeatures and /etc/jobfeatures, including
  hs06_per_machine option and measured size of the scratch partition
- Move assumed vac-shutdown-vm location to /etc/vmtypefiles
- Require lvm2 in SPEC file so we get lvs command to read partition size
==================== Changes in Vac version 0.12.0 =====================
- Add accounting logs in PBS and BLAHP format, optionally including a
  FQAN from the accounting_fqan option for the vmtype.
==================== Changes in Vac version 0.11.0 =====================
- Remove _name from vac_ entries in /etc/machinefeatures and add 
  vac_vmtype
- Automatically copy vac-shutdown-vm into /etc/machinefeatures 
- Add log_machineoutputs to [vmtype ...] sections so contents of 
  /etc/machineoutputs can be written to /var/log/vacd-machineoutputs
==================== Changes in Vac version 0.10.0 =====================
- Mistakes in configuration file(s) now produce an error rather than a
  traceback. vacd now just skips the cycle if the configuration is bad,
  in the hope of it being fixed in the future.  
- total_machines option added to configuration files, so the number
  of VMs desired can be given rather then listing them as virtualmachine
  sections of the file. 
- network_type can be used to specify NAT rather than a bridged network.
- version_logger option allows control over daily logging by UDP of the
  Vac version number in use to vac-version-logger.gridpp.ac.uk:8884
- volume_group, nat_network, and bridge_device options allow tailoring
  of the defaults Vac uses when making disk and network resources 
  available to VMs.
