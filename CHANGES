==================== Changes in Vac version 0.12.0 =====================
- Add accounting logs in PBS and BLAHP format, optionally including a
  FQAN from the accounting_fqan option for the vmtype.
==================== Changes in Vac version 0.11.0 =====================
- Remove _name from vac_ entries in /etc/machinefeatures and add 
  vac_vmtype
- Automatically copy vac-shutdown-vm into /etc/machinefeatures 
- Add log_machineoutputs to [vmtype ...] sections so contents of 
  /etc/machineoutputs can be written to /var/log/vacd-machineoutputs
==================== Changes in Vac version 0.10.0 =====================
- Mistakes in configuration file(s) now produce an error rather than a
  traceback. vacd now just skips the cycle if the configuration is bad,
  in the hope of it being fixed in the future.  
- total_machines option added to configuration files, so the number
  of VMs desired can be given rather then listing them as virtualmachine
  sections of the file. 
- network_type can be used to specify NAT rather than a bridged network.
- version_logger option allows control over daily logging by UDP of the
  Vac version number in use to vac-version-logger.gridpp.ac.uk:8884
- volume_group, nat_network, and bridge_device options allow tailoring
  of the defaults Vac uses when making disk and network resources 
  available to VMs.
