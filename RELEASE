We are pleased to announce the release of Vac 03.00.00

RPMs for CentOS 7 and the Admin Guide are available from the 03.00
subdirectory of

https://repo.gridpp.ac.uk/vacproject/vac/

This version introduces CentOS 7 support, mulitpart Vacuum Pipes, capacity
publishing to GOCDB, and Docker and Singularity container support, as
described in the man pages and Admin Guide.

Vac is now developed and mainly tested on CentOS 7, but should continue
to work on SL6 and equivalent.

The Vacuum Pipe JSON format has changed, with the addition of a 
machinetype key which has a list of machinetype definitions as its value.
The vacuum_pipe_url option to machinetypes in the Vac configuration has
been removed, and replaced with [vacuum_pipe ...] sections which are 
expanded into one or more [machinetype ...] sections when Vac parses a
remote Vacuum Pipe JSON document.

There are no other backwards incompatible changes in the Vac configuration
files when compared to Vac 02.00, but deprecation warnings will displayed
where option names have changed.

The man pages and Admin Guide have been updated to reflect these changes.

If upgrading from a version before Vac 03.00.00, then the factories
must be drained before upgrading Vac as the lock files which keep track
of running machines have changed format to accommodate containers as well
as VMs.
