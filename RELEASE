We are pleased to announce the release of Vac 01.00.00

RPMs for SL6 and the Admin Guide are available from the 01.00
subdirectory of

https://repo.gridpp.ac.uk/vacproject/vac/

There are no backwards incompatible changes in the Vac configuration
files, but VM factories should be drained of VMs and rebooted before
upgrading to this version as the network configuration has changed.
 
The improvements listed in CHANGES are:

- Create 1024 bit GSI proxies
- user_data_option_XXX and user_data_file_XXX options may be given
  in [settings] to set default substitutions for all machinetypes
- GSI proxies given to VMs have machinetype name as final CN
- Fix bug in over-sending vac-version-logger messages
- Add squid-conf to vac command for Puppet etc
- Add per-factory squid cache to Puppet init.pp
- total_*** becomes max_*** in VacQuery 0.4
- Use 169.254.169.253 as default route and MJF HTTP server in case VMs
  block 169.254.169.254 completely to stop user access to EC2 metadata

The man pages and Admin Guide have been updated to reflect these changes.
