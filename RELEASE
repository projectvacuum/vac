We are pleased to announce the release of Vac 0.19.0

RPMs for SL6 and the 0.19 Admin Guide are available from the 0.19
subdirectory of

https://repo.gridpp.ac.uk/vacproject/vac/

This release includes major changes to the internals of Vac but few
changes to the features visible to site admins. There are no backwards
incompatible changes in the configuration. 

- Vac now uses the new VacQuery UDP protocol, which has been redesigned
  for better scalability and tolerance of high UDP packet losses in the
  future.
- The vac utility's subcommand "machines" replaces "scan", and 
  "vmtypes" becomes "machinetypes". Please see the vac(1) man page.
- Experimental support for VacMon is included, with the option to
  send regular VacQuery UDP packets with factory status and vmtype
  activity to one or more VacMon monitoring services.
- The vac.conf(5) man page documents the new configuration options
  forward_dev, mb_per_cpu, min_wallclock_seconds, vacmon_hostport

Upgrades from 0.17.x onwards only require the RPM itself upgrading. To 
upgrade from versions before 0.17.0, please install the 0.19.0 RPM and 
reboot, as Vac's internal NAT network changed style from transient to 
persistent in version 0.17.0.

The man pages and Admin Guide have been updated to reflect these changes.
