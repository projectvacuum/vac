We are pleased to announce the release of Vac 0.19.0

RPMs for SL6 and the 0.19 Admin Guide are available from the 0.19
subdirectory of

https://www.gridpp.ac.uk/vac/versions/

Upgrades from 0.17.x onwards only require the RPM itself upgrading. To 
upgrade from versions before 0.17.0, please install the 0.19.0 RPM and 
reboot, as Vac's internal NAT network changed style from transient to 
persistent in version 0.17.0.



The man pages and Admin Guide have been updated to reflect these changes.
