We are pleased to announce the release of Vac 00.22.00

RPMs for SL6 and the 00.21 Admin Guide are available from the 00.22
subdirectory of

https://repo.gridpp.ac.uk/vacproject/vac/

There are no backwards incompatible changes in the Vac configuration
files. The improvements listed in CHANGES are:

- Create 1024 bit GSI proxies
- user_data_option_XXX and user_data_file_XXX options may be given
  in [settings] to set default substitutions for all machinetypes
- GSI proxies given to VMs have machinetype name as final CN
- Fix bug in over-sending vac-version-logger messages
- Add squid-conf to vac command for Puppet etc
- Add per-factory squid cache to Puppet init.pp
- total_*** becomes max_*** in VacQuery 0.4

The man pages and Admin Guide have been updated to reflect these changes.

Upgrades from 0.17.x onwards only require the RPM itself upgrading. To 
upgrade from versions before 0.17.0, please install the 00.22.00 RPM and
reboot, as Vac's internal NAT network changed style from transient to 
persistent in version 0.17.0.
