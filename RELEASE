We are pleased to announce the release of Vac 0.18.0

RPMs for SL6 and the 0.18 Admin Guide are available from the 0.18
subdirectory of

https://www.gridpp.ac.uk/vac/versions/

Upgrades from 0.17.x only require the RPM itself upgrading. To upgrade 
from versions before 0.17.0, please install the 0.18.0 RPM and reboot, 
as Vac's internal NAT network changed style from transient to 
persistent in version 0.17.0.

Since 0.17.x, this release sees the withdrawl of several options listed 
in CHANGES as deprecated in the 0.17.0 release and some significant 
internal code reorganisation which should be transparent to users but 
allows sharing of common functions with the Vcycle codebase. 

The check-vacd script used by Nagios NRPE and the vacd daemon have been moved 
to /usr/sbin and the Puppet module updated accordingly. The Vac python modules
are now placed in /usr/lib64/python2.6/site-packages/vac.

The new options user_data_proxy_cert / user_data_proxy_key allow Vac to
generate legacy Globus or new-style RFC proxies and pass these to VMs
rather than full host certificates and keys.

shutdown_time can now be given in [settings] to enforce a deadline for all
VMs to stop.

The man pages and Admin Guide have been updated to reflect these changes.
