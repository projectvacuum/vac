RPMs for SL6 and the Admin Guide are available from the 00.22

There are no backwards incompatible changes in the Vac configuration
files. The improvements listed in CHANGES are:

- Create 1024 bit GSI proxies
- user_data_option_XXX and user_data_file_XXX options may be given
  in [settings] to set default substitutions for all machinetypes
- GSI proxies given to VMs have machinetype name as final CN

- Add squid-conf to vac command for Puppet etc
- Add per-factory squid cache to Puppet init.pp

The man pages and Admin Guide have been updated to reflect these changes.

Upgrades from 0.17.x onwards only require the RPM itself upgrading.
