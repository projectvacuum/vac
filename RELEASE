We are pleased to announce the release of Vac 00.21.00

RPMs for SL6 and the 00.20 Admin Guide are available from the 00.21
subdirectory of

https://repo.gridpp.ac.uk/vacproject/vac/

There are no backwards incompatible changes in the Vac configuration
files, but some significant simplifications in Vac's dependencies.

- Vac no longer uses an NFS server on each factory (an internal HTTP
  server is used instead.)
- The vac RPM installs a vac-ssmsend cron job which runs APEL ssmsend
  automatically if ssmsend is installed and its cert/key pair exist.
- The vacd SysV service runs ssmsend when shutting down to ensure that
  unsent job usage records are sent when factories are shutting down.
- Vac now refers to types of virtual machine as "machinetypes" rather
  than "vmtypes" (in preparation for container support) and this
  word can now be used in the Vac configuration instead of "vmtype".
- CernVM image signing can be checked.
- A vac-command RPM is provided, which installs the vac command
  and dependencies, without the vacd daemon itself.

The man pages and Admin Guide have been updated to reflect these changes.

Upgrades from 0.17.x onwards only require the RPM itself upgrading. To 
upgrade from versions before 0.17.0, please install the 00.21.00 RPM and 
reboot, as Vac's internal NAT network changed style from transient to 
persistent in version 0.17.0.
