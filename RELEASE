We are pleased to announce the release of Vac 00.21

RPMs for SL6 and the 00.21 Admin Guide are available from the 00.21
subdirectory of

https://repo.gridpp.ac.uk/vacproject/vac/

There are no backwards incompatible changes in the Vac configuration
files, but some further simplifications and consequent deprecations
of configuration options.

- Vac now provides a single disk device to each VM: either a logical
  volume (preferred) or a file-backed disk image. In logical volume
  mode, file-backed disks for the root partitions are no longer 
  created. You may wish to increase the size of the vac_volume_group
  and decrease the size of the partition containing /var/lib/vac on
  the factories to reflect this.
- Logical volumes are now created/destroyed on the fly for each VM,
  with their default size based on the space available in the 
  vac_volume_group.
- Machine/Job Features supplied to VMs now include the key/value
  pairs defined in the HSF-TN-2016-02 Technical Note.
- Vac will refuse to create VMs if there is less than 1 GB free in the 
  partition containing /var/lib/vac
- The default for overload_per_cpu is reduced to 1.5
- The handling of VacQuery query messages has been streamlined to 
  cope better on highly overloaded factories.
- Vac now generates 1024 rather than 512 bit GSI proxies

The man pages and Admin Guide have been updated to reflect these changes.

Upgrades from 0.17 onwards only require the RPM itself upgrading. To 
upgrade from versions before 0.17, please install the 00.21 RPM and
reboot, as Vac's internal NAT network changed style from transient to 
persistent in version 0.17.0.
