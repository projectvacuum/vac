.SH DESCRIPTION
.B vac
is a command-line utility for querying the status of vacd(8) factory

.B The format of the results of this command may change without notice, and should not be relied on by other scripts etc.

.SH GENERAL OPTIONS

.HP 
.B "-h, --help"
.br
Show help message and exit

.HP 
.B "-s SPACENAME, --space=SPACENAME"

Override Vac space given in the configuration file

.SH COMMANDS

.HP
.B "machines [factory1] [factory2] [...]"
.br
This command uses the VacQuery UDP Protocol to contact the factory machines in this
Vac space and outputs a summary of their responses. Each line in the output
corresponds to the reported status of one virtual machine slot. This command
can be used to get a quick overview of the status of a Vac space, including 
which machinetypes are running and where, and the outcomes of virtual machines 
that are currently shut down. By default all factories in the current
space are contacted, but this can be limited to one or more by giving the
hostnames of factory machines on the command line. Hostnames will be
canonicalised if the FQDN isn't given.

If no virtual machines have run on a factory, then no responses are
returned, and at a new site you will get no output from this command
until some VMs have at least started.

.HP
.B "machinetype MACHINETYPE"
.br
Shows the most recent status of the given machinetype on the virtual machine
slots of all factories that respond. This includes virtual machines which
ran for this machinetype but have shut down, and will display their shutdown 
messages if available. 

.HP
.B "factories factory1 [factory2] [...]"
.br
Outputs the raw responses from one or more factory machines.

.HP
.B "proxy-init"
.br
Requires the --cert and --key options and may take the --legacy-proxy
option. Creates a legacy Globus proxy or RFC proxy (the default.) 

.HP
.B "cernvm-signature image
.br
Outputs the CernVM metadata and signature information from an image,
indicating if the signature verification succeeded and the associated
signing X.509 DN.

.HP
.B "apel-sync [YYYYMM [YYYYMM [YYYYMM ... ]]]"
.br
Takes zero or more six digit year-month strings and writes APEL
Sync message record file(s) to today's subdirectory of 
/var/lib/vac/apel-outgoing based on the corresponding months'
records in daily subdirectories of /var/lib/vac/apel-archive . If
no year-month string is given on the command line, then the year-month
containing the time 24 hours before now is used. This means that vac
apel-sync can be run every day from cron to publish sync summaries of
the current month's progress, with a final whole-month summary being
published during the first day of the next month.

.SH CONFIGURATION FILES

The vac command uses the settings of the
.B vac.conf(5)
configuration by default, unless overriden by the command line options
described above.
