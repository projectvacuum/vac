.SH COMMANDS

.HP
.B "scan [factory1] [factory2] [...]"
.br
This command uses the Vac UDP protocol to contact the factory machines in this
Vac space and outputs a summary of their responses. Each line in the output
corresponds to the reported status of one virtual machine slot. This command
can be used to get a quick overview of the status of a Vac space, including 
which vmtypes are running and where, and the outcomes of virtual machines 
that are currently shut down. By default all factories in the current
space are contacted, but this can be limited to one or more by giving the
FQDNs of factory machines on the command line.

Each line of output consists of: the virtual machine short hostname; the
vmtype which most recently ran on that VM; an asterisk if the VM has been
running for more than fizzle_seconds; the VM state (Running, Starting, Shut
down); how long the VM has been running or starting, or the most recent
shutdown_message; the CPU usage percentage over the lifetime of the VM for
running VMs; the CPU usage percentage during the last cycle (by default 60
seconds); the round trip time for the UDP query and response in seconds.
